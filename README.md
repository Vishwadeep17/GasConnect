# FuelUp
FuelUp is a MERN stack gas station search application that scrapes stations and fuel prices from GasBuddy and displays the information in a list and map format. Also includes user authentication in order to save gas stations.

## Problem
When it comes to searching for fuel prices, there are few sources where you can find accurate information. Applications like GasBuddy and Google Maps are able to provide you that information, but with a couple of restraints. Both of these applications don't display all of the fuel types from the beginning and require a series of clicks before revealing a list of types. Another issue that lies within GasBuddy is that you would need to navigate away from your search in order to view a map of all stations in your local area.

## Future Development
* Add an extra dropdown in favorites to filter by location
* Potentially add a new page to monitor your yearly gas expenses
